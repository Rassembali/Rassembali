🚀 About Me

🎓 I’m Rassem Bali, a final-year Industrial Computer Engineering student at ENET’Com (Tunisia), specializing in Robotics, Computer Vision, and Artificial Intelligence.
My work focuses on building intelligent and autonomous systems through deep learning, reinforcement learning, and computer vision.

🧠 What I Do

I’ve developed AI-driven systems across robotics, vision, and data science, including:

🧭 Autonomous navigation for TurtleBot3 using DQN and TinySLAM in ROS2.

🧠 Digital pathology pipelines with U-Net segmentation and CNN classification (Grad-CAM explainability).

🚗 GTA V self-driving car simulation combining YOLOv8 segmentation and PPO reinforcement learning.

🔍 OCR system for Tunisian license plates using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Tesseract.

🌄 Monocular depth estimation with MiDaS and the KITTI dataset.

🧩 LoRA fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion for efficient generative image modeling.

📈 Data science project at CRNS using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for magnetocaloric performance prediction.
